# DSA Practice with Golang

Welcome to my repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Golang! This is a work in progress as I learn and implement different data structures and algorithms.

## Current Progress

### Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

### Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sanzib-hub/go-dsa.git
